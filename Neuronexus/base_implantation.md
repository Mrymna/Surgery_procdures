# Base implantation

Make sure you added the [4 nuts to your base](prepare_base.md) before starting this procedure.

You will also need a ground screw.


## Potential problem to avoid

One critical point when cementing the base to the skull is to make sure that you will have all the space needed to implant your microdrive later on. 
To make sure this is the case, I attach a microdrive to the microdrive holder and position the microdrive at the coordinates needed for probe implantation.
I cement the base with the microdrive at the implantation sites. This ensure that the microdrive will fit in the base when we will do the probe implantation.

## Prepare the animal

## Mark your implantation sites

## Add a ground screw

## Cement the base

## Close the wound
