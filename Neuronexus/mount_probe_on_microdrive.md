# Prepare the probes.

1. For each probe, solder the ground and reference wires together
2. Add a single wire that will be use to connect all probes to the same ground.
Use a large solder blob to burn the insulation from the tips of the wires.
Cut the wire to approximately 2 cm long
Add a copper wire if 5 cm.


# Glue probes together (if needed; highly experimental(

1. Place the two probes next to each other.
