# Cleaning procedure for Neuronexus probes

## Preparation of a Tergazyme solution

Tergazyme is a concentrated, anionic detergent with protease enzyme for manual and ultrasonic cleaning. Excellent for removal of proteinaceous soils, tissue, blood and body fluids from glassware, metals, plastic, ceramic, porcelain, rubber and fiberglass with no interfering residues. Ideal as a cleaning agent in Reverse Osmosis and Ultra-Filtration Systems. USDA authorized. Dilute: 1:100. pH 9.5

* Solution: 0.4 g of Tergazyme powder into 40 ml of distilled water. Put it on the stirer for 10 minutes.

* Put the probe back in the protective case, with a plastic cup below it.
* Add the Tergazyme solution to cover approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the shanks of the probe.

* Remove the Tergazyme solution, 
* Add distilled water to cover most of the shanks to remove any detergent or residue. Put it on the shaker at 50 RPM for 30 minutes. Remove the water.
* Repeate the previous step 2 times.

## Verify that the probe is clean

After 3 washing cycles, your probes should be perfectly cleaned. Have a look under the microscope to make sure there is no tissue left on the probes.

See the figure for an example of dirty probe. You don't want to let this dry on your shanks as this might compromise your recording sites.

## Storage of the probes

* Make sure that the shanks are not stuck together. If they are, use a microscope and a fine needle to separate them.
* Leave the probe in its protective case and store it in a safe place. It should be stored in a closed case so that there is no dust accumulating on it.
