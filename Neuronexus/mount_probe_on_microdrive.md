# Prepare the probes.

1. For each probe, solder the ground and reference wires together
2. Add a single wire that will be use to connect all probes to the same ground.
Use a large solder blob to burn the insulation from the tips of the wires.
Cut the wire to approximately 2 cm long
Add a copper wire of 5 cm.


# Glue probes together (if needed; highly experimental(

1. Place the two probes next to each other.

# Mount the first probe

1. Remove the probe from its case and attach to a crocodile üêä clip that can be manipulated by the stereotaxic frame 
2. Make sure the ground wires are towards what would be the nose of the animal.
