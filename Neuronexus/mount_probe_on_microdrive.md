# Mounting the probe onto the microdrive

The procedure will vary depending on the specific probe and the microdrive configuration.

We are still improving the procedure to reduce the risk of damaging the probe during these steps.

## 1 x 64 channel probe on single-probe microdrive

This was a configuration we use to establsh recording for the MEC.

### Add the PCB to the PCB plate

1. Prepare a PCB holder plate with copper shielding.
2. Mount the PCB of the probe in the PCB holder plate.

1. For each probe, solder the ground and reference wires together
2. Add a single wire that will be use to connect all probes to the same ground.
Use a large solder blob to burn the insulation from the tips of the wires.
Cut the wire to approximately 2 cm long
Add a copper wire of 5 cm.


# Glue probes together (if needed; highly experimental(

1. Place the two probes next to each other.

# Mount the first probe

1. Remove the probe from its case and attach to a crocodile üêä clip that can be manipulated by the stereotaxic frame 
2. Make sure the ground wires are towards what would be the nose of the animal.
