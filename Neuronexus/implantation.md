## mounting the case for the microdrive

* screw the two parts together. always look at your probes so you dont accidentally distroy them. you can feel when the screws go to the nuts. 
* trun the screw enough that it can holds the drive and at the same time if you put so much pressure you are going to distroy it. 
* the probe should be almost at the top position. almost 1-2 turn from the top.

* the screw that is located the one towards you is the one you should turn. the other one at the back is releasing the probe from the drive. 
* Move the probe out of the way and bring the animal.
