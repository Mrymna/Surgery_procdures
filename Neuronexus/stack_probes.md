# Stack probes

To increase the number of channels that we can record from, I stacked probes on top of each other. This is highly experimental and requires good level of dexterity. 

As each probe costs approximately 1000 Euro, be very careful.

## Prepare the ground wires

Work at a workshop microscope with a soldering machine.

1. For each probe, cut the ground (green) and reference (blue/white) wires to approximately 2 cm long.
2. Use a large solder blob to burn 1 mm of insulation from the tips of the wires.
3. Remove the burnt isolation still covering the naked wire.
4. Place the 3 wires so that their exposed end touch each other and apply flux.
5. Solder the wires together. 
6. Cut a copper wire at approximately 5 cm, remove the insulation at one end with solder. Solder the copper wire to the 3 other wire. 

## Glue the probes on top of each other

Work with a surgical microscope and a stereotaxic frame.

You need to be very careful with the probes, especially when the two probes are close to one another.

1. Leave the probes in their shipping box. 
2. Get an amplifier with 2 connectors (Intan 64 channels).
3. Connect a first probe to an implifier.
4. Bring a second probe next to the first one and connect it to the amplifier.
5. Mount the probe holder on the stereotaxic arm. 
6. Grab the front half of the second probe with the probe holder. 
7. Bring the second probe on top of the first one.
8. Precisely align the 2 probes so that the tips are parallel and have the same length. This is critical.
9. Add a small drop of epoxy glue betwen the two probes, towards the back. The glue should go between the two probes. Try not to make the probes any wider with the glue.
10. Wait 15 minutes. 
11. Release the second probe and add a bit more glue and wait another 15 minutes.
